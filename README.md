# Book Search
![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)


## Description

This project refactors a fully functional Google Books search engine from a RESTful API architecture to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), the application allows users to search for books via the Google Books API and save their favorite titles. The update includes implementing GraphQL queries and mutations, integrating Apollo Client on the front end, updating authentication to work with GraphQL, and deploying the full-stack application to Render with a MongoDB Atlas database.
